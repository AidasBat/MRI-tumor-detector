# MRI Tumor Detector (PyTorch)

## This project is currently under active development. Features, models, and functionalities may change frequently.

This repository aims to build a deep learning-based MRI tumor detection model using PyTorch. The goal is to develop
an AI-powered system that can assist in detecting and classifying brain tumors from MRI scans.

The dataset used in this project consists of MRI brain scans with labeled tumor regions.
